This directory contains the Makefile and associated 
flex and .c files needed to create the masm assembler.

The Makefile is currently written to support the NRAND 
and RSHIFT operators that we demonstrated in class.

You must modify these files to add the new operators 
(MULT and DIV) to the flex .ll file (and eliminate NRAND),
and modify the .c compiler file so that it can generate
code for the new operators, as shown in class.

Use the Makefile to rebuild the masm, and then assemble the
test files and run them against your new microcode.
