There is no specific answer to the degree of success for a certain project. it is depend on what project i will have to 
dealing with. for example, if i work on a project to authenticate a user in PHP i would grade myself for at least 80% 
compare to 50% on C. since i am not really familiar with C, i have to refer to the book for sometimes. In this assignment i 
don't really have any serious problem. it is very straight forward because some of the code is provided. All i do is to 
convert to Hex and format the output as require by the assignment. overall, the result of the output is expected to be as 
in the assignment require.
