I may grade it for 85 percent. because i think all the functionality is seem to be working as requirement. 
but the code it not really clean. for example, i use more variables than it should be. to approach the problem,
first i scan 2 number and store to the union, then i add the mantissa parts of the two floating number and take
only 23 bits of the result and put with the common exponent and the sign. 
it would take me few hours to finish this homework.
